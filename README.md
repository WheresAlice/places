# Places

A website that renders the geojson export of my Google Maps saved places.

These tend to be places I have visited and would return to, but it's really just an arbitrary collection of places that I want to remember for some reason.

## Dev notes

* Google Takeaway export of Google Places
* Update the GitHub Gist with the contents of the geojson file
* Embedded on a simple html page on Netlify
